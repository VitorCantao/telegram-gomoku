## Telegram-Gomoku
[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku "Gomoku"), also known as "Connect-5" or "Five in a row", is a traditional two-player strategy board game. This is the web client for a simple online version of gomoku we made for the Telegram instant messenger. It was our first web project and our first finished game that took longer than a day to build, so we are rather proud. ðŸ¥³
